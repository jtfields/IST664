kneel by grandpa's grave\\nMama started wailing asking god if he was saved\\nI never liked to see my daddy cry\\nI guess I'll never know how grandpa died\\nAnd what I'd give to go there again\\nKiss my daddy's face, hold my mama's hand\\nLittle did I know soon they would be lying right beside him\\nGone away from me\\nYou barely even see the tombstones now\\nThe trees are grown up everywhere and no one keeps the grounds\\nStrangers live inside my childhood home\\nAnd I can't believe that daddy's really gone\\nWhat I'd give to go there again\\nKiss his withered face, hold her gentle hand\\nBut there ain't no way that will ever be\\nThey're lying 'neath that oak tree gone away from me\\nWell I grew up in a town with one red light\\n\\nHolly Williams – acoustic guitar, vocal\\nJackson Browne

god she'll love me one of these days\\nI hope I find my way waiting on June\\nI went off in ‘42 to fight those boys and pay my dues\\nHer wallet picture kept my spirits high\\nCharley boy died in my arms, he saw Jesus I saw blood\\nIt soaked her wallet picture that cold night\\nI told my best friend charley I would kiss his girl goodbye\\nHe made me promise I’d go home and make miss June my wife\\nShaking like a drunk old fool I hopped off of that plane\\nAnd I ran home to ask her in the rain\\nWaiting on June, I hope that she says yes\\nWaiting on June, in her faded summer dress\\nWaiting on June, her daddy shook my hand\\nAnd she lit up the moment I pulled out that silver band\\nWaiting on June\\nWell we married at the Methodist church\\nFound a big white cow and a piece of dirt with pecan trees to build our homestead on\\nJolynn, Becky then Donna then Shelby our tiny house was a sanctuary\\nLaughter filled those rooms all day long\\nWaiting on June, she's putting on her makeup\\nWaiting on June, she's trying to get her hair curled\\nWaiting on June, kids listen to me\\nYou walk on down to Sunday school I'll be there in 15\\nWaiting on June\\nThe time flew by like they said it would\\nThe kids grew fast and the farm did good\\nMrs. Bertha made our supper everyday\\nAt noon that silver bell would ring\\nWe'd all say grace and dig on in we always ate together in those days\\nOh one by one those kids went off and found a love their own\\nThere’s nothing like the joy I knew when they brought their babies home\\nWe'd play all day in the cotton fields with the dogs I raised up right\\nAnd end in grandma's kitchen every night\\nWaiting on June, honey don't burn the bacon\\nWaiting on June, our bellies are a' achin\\nWaiting on June, she turns that fork so slow\\nAnd we all had to sit there til the last bite was no more\\n\\nHolly Williams – acoustic guitar, vocal\\nGwyneth Paltrow – background vocal\\nChris Coleman – acoustic guitar, background

time you used to know\\nMemories can't touch you they are just a picture show\\nDont let go, oh honey can't you see\\nEverythings a circle in itself\\nAll as it should be\\n\\nHave you stood inside a nightmare\\nDid it slap you in the face\\nWere you left to lose control\\nDid you ever find a way\\nWas it somebody that loved you or a face you've never seen\\nSo final, so quick are the hands of

could...\\nTo the passion of your life\\n\\nThere is someone out there watching every step you take today\\nEvery struggle, all confusion, endless questions in your head\\nBut he's got you where he
